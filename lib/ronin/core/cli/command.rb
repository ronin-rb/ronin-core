      #
      # Common base class for all CLI commands.
      #
      # ## Example
      #
      # Define a common CLI command base class for all commands in the
      # `ronin-foo` library:
      #
      #     # lib/ronin/foo/cli/command.rb
      #     require 'ronin/core/cli/command'
      #
      #     module Ronin
      #       module Foo
      #         class CLI
      #           class Command < Core::CLI::Command
      #
      #             man_dir File.join(__dir__,'..','..','..','..','man')
      #
      #           end
      #         end
      #       end
      #     end
      #
      # Define a sub-command named `list` under the `ronin-foo` main command:
      #
      #     # lib/ronin/foo/cli/commands/list.rb
      #     require 'ronin/foo/cli/command'
      #
      #     module Ronin
      #       module Foo
      #         class CLI
      #           module Commands
      #             class List < Command
      #
      #               usage '[options] [NAME]'

      #                               desc:     'Optional name to list'
      #
      #               description 'Lists all things'
      #
      #               man_page 'ronin-foo-list.1'
